# description
This coding challenge was part of the edX UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Bootcamp. They provided the dataset and instructions.

# code
The code needed to loop through all of the stocks for each year and output a summary of ticker, yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume. Then there is a second summary table with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.

# acknowledgement
I received help from the edX bootcamp instructor's activity files which used code for loops and conditional formatting as well as searching online for additional coding help for VBA script.
