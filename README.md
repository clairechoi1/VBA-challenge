# description
This coding challenge was part of the edX UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Bootcamp. The dataset and instructions to analyze generated stock market data were provided.

# code
The VBA script needed to loop through all of the stock data per year and output a summary of ticker name, yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume. Then there is a second summary table that covers the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.

# acknowledgement
I received help from the edX bootcamp activity files which included code for loops and conditional formatting as well as searching online for additional coding help for VBA script.
